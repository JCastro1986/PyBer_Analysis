# PyBer Analysis Challenge
Challenge #5. Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Overview of Pyber Challenge Analysis
- As a fresh data analyst I have been assigned my first big project, it is a great opportunity to show what I am made off to my CEO, V. Isualize.
- I would need to work with a very big amount of data and be able to summarize it and makes it way more readable.
- I will present my results using graphs, this will make it easier to better understand rideshare data.
- Displaying information graphically will help V. Isualize make key decisions that will improve the rideshare service.
 
The main goal of this project is:
1. Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
2. Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
3. Submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

- The first thing that stands out in the previous image is that Rural cities have the lowest performance rates.
- The second-best performance rates are the Subrural cities.

## Summary
Based on our analysis we can state with certainty that we need to focus our attention on Rural first and later to Subrural cities as they have the lowest performance rates.
Business recommendations to the CEO:
1. We should focus on increasing the number of rides by implementing a marketing campaign focusing more on Rural and Subrural with special discounts as users use more PyBer. 
- "After 4 rides get the 5th on us"
- This campaign will cost PyBer money at the beginning but when the level of customers rises the increase in rides in Rural and Subrural city types will compensate for previous losses and will increase performance rates in the long run.
2. We should focus on increasing the number of drivers in Rural and Subrural. PyBer will create a special compensation to incentivize drivers to work in Rural and Subrural locations. This will increase the availability of drivers and will help PyBer be ready when launching the previous marketing campaign. 
- This special compensation to drivers will PyBer money at the beginning but when the level of customer rises the increase in rides in Rural and Subrural city types will compensate previous investment and will increase profits to the company.
- This increase of drivers will prepare PyBer for its upcoming growth. 
3. We should focus on increasing the number of customers using PyBer by implementing a marketing campaign focusing on Rural and Subrural city types when every time someone recommends the app and a new user gets his first ride, the first one will get a free ride.
- "For every recommendation, you get a free ride with PyBer"
- This campaign will cost PyBer money at the beginning but when the level of customer increase, so will the total number of rides in Rural and Subrural city types, and these new customers will compensate for previous investment and will increase performance rates in the long run.
